        - A cyber attack happens roughly every 39 seconds on average.
        <br>
        <br>
        - A large majority (around 95%) of data breaches are caused by human error, like weak
        passwords or clicking phishing links.
        <br>
        <br>
        - Data breaches can be extremely costly for businesses, both in terms of financial loss
        and reputational damage.
        <br>
        <br>
        - Attackers use malware like viruses and ransomware to infiltrate systems and steal data.
        <br>
        <br>
        - Employees with malicious intent can pose a significant cyber security risk to their companies.
        <br>
        <br>
        - Cybercrime is considered a lucrative business, with estimates of significant annual damages.
